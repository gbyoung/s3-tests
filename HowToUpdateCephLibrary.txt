Treat the Ceph library as part of the StorReduce repository as if any regular directory.

If you need to update the library and push the changes, you first need to add a Git Subtree remote:
git remote add ceph-tests git@github.com:gavinong10/s3-tests.git

Then, in the root directory, you can push changes:

git subtree push --prefix=test/ceph-tests/ ceph-tests master

This only needs to be done once in a while.

Probably more importantly, if we want to sync S3 ceph tests from the origin:
-> Merge the fork with the source
-> git subtree pull --prefix=test/ceph-tests/ ceph-tests master
